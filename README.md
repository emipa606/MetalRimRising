Metal Rim Rising is a mod created by the **aRatoCat** team to add a bit more "memes" to Rimworld. After all... Memes are the DNA of the soul. 

Focus primarily on armor penetration, most weapons added to this mod have high armor penetration value but often low damage or low speed. Bionics and equipment are more specialized, allowing for more interesting abilities that aren't simply a number increase. Although some are simply there to make your pawn feels f-cking invincible. 

**Note; **Yes. We are aware of stacking the tough trait with all 5 bionics creates an invincible pawn. If you wish to edit the values yourself, it is a very simple XML file edit. But if you're seriously complaining about a Metal Gear Rising; Revengeance mod being "OP," then maybe you shouldn't stack all 5 extremely powerful bionics on top of an already powerful vanilla base trait. 

# KNOWN ISSUES;


D.E.S Exo suit not detonating in some unusual cases
Vanilla Shield Belt sometime detonating in unusual cases.
